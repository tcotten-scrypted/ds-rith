Rodents in The Hood (RiTH) from the Scrypted Team

Beavers everywhere! This game features 3 NPC characters that are trying to conquer the map by painting every tile they step on their color, all while players are feeding them their favorite goo for power-ups.

It’s the ultimate graffiti meta-game!

Clyde: Red
Boomer: Blue
Moxie: Green

For the Redstone Hackathon we concentrated on being able to create a “max size” (40 tile radius) map as well as agent that can walk around randomly on the map and paint the tiles.

We reached 2 out of 3 goals:
1. (DONE) Map Making and Tooling
2. (DONE) Random Walk for 1 AI Agent
3. (INCOMPLETE) Painting Tiles

We have big dreams for coming iterations and eventual release on Redstone!
